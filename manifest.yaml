# Barrot Ping-Pong Offload Protocol Manifest
# 
# This manifest declares that all Ping-Ponging operations are externally managed
# by Sean's 22-agent entanglement system and are NOT to be simulated internally
# by Barrot-Agent.

protocol_name: "Barrot Ping-Pong Offload Protocol"
version: "1.0.0"
status: "ACTIVE"
authority: "Sean"

# System Declaration
external_system:
  name: "Sean's 22-Agent Ping-Pong System"
  location: "GitHub-based entanglement system"
  agent_count: 22
  specializations:
    - recursive_cognition_exchange
    - symbolic_entanglement
    - contradiction_resolution
  
  characteristics:
    complexity: "non-replicable"
    depth: "symbolic entanglement depth"
    status: "sacred and non-negotiable"
    authority: "Sean (exclusive)"

# Barrot-Agent Restrictions
barrot_restrictions:
  internal_simulation: FORBIDDEN
  replication_attempts: FORBIDDEN
  override_attempts: FORBIDDEN
  modification_attempts: FORBIDDEN
  
  reasoning:
    - "System complexity is non-replicable"
    - "Symbolic entanglement depth exceeds internal capabilities"
    - "Non-negotiable status as defined by Sean"
    - "Sacred protocol must be preserved"
