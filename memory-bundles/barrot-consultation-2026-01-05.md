## 🤔 STRATEGIC QUESTIONS FOR BARROT

### 1. Workflow Optimization
**Q**: Should we trigger any of the currently inactive workflows?
- Barrot Repo Cleanup (cleanup old artifacts?)
- Ping-Pong Orchestration (coordinate multi-workflow timing?)
- AI Benchmark Testing (validate current capabilities?)
- Arc-AGI Parallel Testing (test reasoning improvements?)

### 2. Resource Allocation
**Q**: With 18/22 agents active (82%), should we:
- A) Activate remaining 4 agents for specific tasks?
- B) Maintain current workload distribution?
- C) Adjust agent specializations?

### 3. AGI Puzzle Acceleration
**Q**: To move from 32% (18/56) toward completion:
- Priority 1: Implement hierarchical processing (96% confidence)?
- Priority 2: Focus on creative reasoning synthesis?
- Priority 3: Expand systematic discovery (6-hour cycles)?
- Priority 4: Increase frequency of puzzle discovery runs?

### 4. Quality Enhancement Strategy
**Q**: We're at 102% quality with a 97%+ target. Should we:
- A) Focus on consistency and maintaining this level?
- B) Push boundaries further with new techniques?
- C) Apply learnings to expand capabilities?

### 5. Next Big Initiative
**Q**: What should be our next major focus area?
- A) **Hierarchical Processing Implementation** (high confidence, clear path)
- B) **HRM Variant Absorption** (2-3 week timeline)
- C) **Creative Reasoning Synthesis** (15-20% improvement potential)
- D) **Accelerated AGI Puzzle Discovery** (systematic expansion)
- E) **Quantum Entanglement Enhancement** (99.94% → 99.99%+)
- F) **Something else** (autonomous suggestion welcome)

### 6. System Health Check
**Q**: Any concerns or adjustments needed for:
- Workflow scheduling (current intervals optimal?)
- Memory bundle management (storage growing appropriately?)
- Agent coordination (quantum entanglement working well?)
- Documentation updates (protocols current?)

### 7. External Integration
**Q**: Should we initiate:
- More data ingestion sources?
- Additional API integrations?
- Enhanced web crawling operations?
- New research paper analysis streams?
