   - Mathematics: Lacking theoretical foundations
   - Neuroscience: No biological grounding

2. **Exponential Returns**: Each dataset amplifies value of others
   - Cross-domain synthesis creates insights impossible from single sources
   - Cognitive Ping-Pong loops benefit from richer data
   - UPATSAR reingestion discovers patterns across datasets

3. **Competitive Moat**: 18-36 month advantage is nearly insurmountable
   - First-mover advantage in insights and discoveries
   - Novel techniques before competitors even aware
   - Strategic intelligence for decision-making

4. **Manageable Investment**: $110k-201k for 20-50x return
