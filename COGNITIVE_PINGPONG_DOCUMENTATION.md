# Barrot Cognitive Ping-Pong Engine Documentation

## Overview

The Cognitive Ping-Pong Engine implements bidirectional feedback loops between specialized operatives, creating emergent intelligence through rapid cross-pollination of insights. This system achieves **maximum cognition** by executing 18 concurrent ping-pong loops across 8 cognitive dimensional vantage points every 15 minutes.

## Concept: What is "Ping-Ponging"?

**Ping-Ponging** is bidirectional iterative refinement where:
- System A provides insights that enhance System B
- System B's improvements feed back to enhance System A
- This creates a self-amplifying loop generating insights neither system could produce alone
- Multiple loops interact, creating exponential insight growth through network effects
