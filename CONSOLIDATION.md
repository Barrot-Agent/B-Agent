## Merge Strategy

### Priority Order
1. Foundation: feature/shrm-v2 (base SHRM system)
2. Infrastructure: Micro-Agent-workflow (workflow foundation)
3. Comprehensive: copilot/optimize-workflow-structure (integrated systems)
4. Unified: copilot/reassess-directives-and-processes (framework unification)
5. Evolution: SHRM v2 evolution branches (enhancements)
6. Cognitive: All cognitive enhancement branches
7. Datasets: Dataset and learning branches
8. Revenue: Website and revenue branches
9. Utilities: Remaining improvements and fixes

### Conflict Resolution
- **Status**: No conflicts detected between any branches and Main
- **Method**: All merges can proceed cleanly
- **Strategy**: Merge in priority order to build features incrementally

## Consolidation Log

### Branches Merged
_(To be updated as branches are merged)_

| Branch | Commits | Files Changed | Merge Date | Notes |
|--------|---------|---------------|------------|-------|
| - | - | - | - | Not yet started |

### Branches Archived
_(To be updated after cleanup)_

| Branch | Reason | Archive Date |

## Post-Consolidation Tasks
- [ ] Update README with all consolidated features
- [ ] Create comprehensive CHANGELOG
- [ ] Update workflows to ensure compatibility
- [ ] Run full test suite
- [ ] Security audit
- [ ] Documentation review
- [ ] Performance optimization

## Notes
- All branches branch from Main commit `61f714f`
- No merge conflicts detected
- Repository uses minimal dependencies (package.json only has basic info)
- Multiple workflow files need coordination after merge
