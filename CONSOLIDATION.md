## Merge Strategy

### Priority Order
1. Foundation: feature/shrm-v2 (base SHRM system)
2. Infrastructure: Micro-Agent-workflow (workflow foundation)
3. Comprehensive: copilot/optimize-workflow-structure (integrated systems)
4. Unified: copilot/reassess-directives-and-processes (framework unification)
5. Evolution: SHRM v2 evolution branches (enhancements)
6. Cognitive: All cognitive enhancement branches
7. Datasets: Dataset and learning branches
8. Revenue: Website and revenue branches
9. Utilities: Remaining improvements and fixes

### Conflict Resolution
- **Status**: No conflicts detected between any branches and Main
- **Method**: All merges can proceed cleanly
- **Strategy**: Merge in priority order to build features incrementally

## Cleanup Script

A cleanup script is available to help remove merged branches:

```bash
#!/bin/bash
# cleanup_merged_branches.sh
# Run this script to delete all merged branches from remote

branches=(
  "feature/shrm-v2"
  "Micro-Agent-workflow"
  "copilot/optimize-workflow-structure"
  "copilot/reassess-directives-and-processes"
  "copilot/evolution-of-shrm-v2"
  "copilot/evolve-shrm-into-v2-0"
  "copilot/evolve-shrm-to-v2-0"
  "copilot/evolve-shrm-to-v2-0-again"
  "copilot/enable-barrot-cognitive-enhancements"
  "copilot/enhance-cognitive-capabilities"
  "copilot/enhance-barrot-functionality"
  "copilot/implement-barrot-cognition-logic"
  "copilot/ping-pong-barrot-shrm"
  "copilot/implement-ping-pongings-infrastructure"

  "copilot/suggest-next-steps-development"
  "copilot/add-barrot-workflows"
  "copilot/add-snapshot-functionality"
)

echo "This will delete ${#branches[@]} branches from the remote repository."
echo "Press Ctrl+C to cancel, or Enter to continue..."
read

for branch in "${branches[@]}"; do
  echo "Deleting: $branch"
  git push origin --delete "$branch"
done

echo "Branch cleanup complete!"
```

Save this as `cleanup_merged_branches.sh` and run with appropriate permissions after verifying the consolidation.

## Notes
- All branches branch from Main commit `61f714f`
- No merge conflicts detected
- Repository uses minimal dependencies (package.json only has basic info)
- Multiple workflow files need coordination after merge
