## Ingestion Protocol

All ingestions follow the MMI v1.0 protocol:
1. Multi-scale component analysis (6 scales)
2. Recursive source lineage tracking (4 levels)
3. SHRM v2.0 integration (biological/temporal plasticity, contradiction vectorization, hermetic principles)
4. Knowledge graph integration
5. Cross-reference tagging

## File Structure

Each ingestion file includes:
- Ingestion metadata (ID, timestamp, protocol version)
- Full MMI analysis across all component scales
- Complete source lineage with 4-level recursion
- SHRM v2.0 integration insights
- Key insights and practical applications
- Validation and next actions
