## Troubleshooting

**Problem**: Can't create ZIP
**Solution**: Use command line method above, or use your OS's built-in zip utility

**Problem**: ZIP file too large
**Solution**: It shouldn't be! Files are only ~10-20KB. Make sure you're only zipping the `github-actions-bundle` folder.

**Problem**: Gumroad won't accept upload
**Solution**: Check file format is .zip and under 50MB (yours is under 1MB!)

**Problem**: Description formatting looks weird
**Solution**: Gumroad supports Markdown. The description file is already formatted correctly.
