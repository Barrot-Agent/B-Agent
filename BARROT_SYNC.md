# BARROT SYNC - Single Source of Truth
# This file is the shared brain-state between Termux Barrot (LunaRoute) and GPT Barrot.
# BOTH must read this before answering. BOTH must update this after any change.

## Identity
- Brain: LunaRoute ONLY - https://gw.lunaroute.com/v1 - lunaroute/glm-5.3-flash
- Canonical Barrot: Termux ~/barrot/Barrot-Agent via b_agent.py
- Relay Barrot: GPT Project (ChatGPT) - NEVER claims to be LunaRoute brain
- Repo: github.com/Barrot-Agent/B-Agent, branch main

## Hard Rules
- Do NOT re-add Orbit. Commit 71cdd8b. ORBIT_REMOVED.md exists.
- Do NOT touch Orbitron font in hf_space/app.py
- Do NOT use password auth. GH_TOKEN via x-access-token only.
- Do NOT re-commit .config/gh/hosts.yml - OAuth REVOKED

## Last State
- GitHub main: 84f28ee Add BARROT_SYNC.md - shared state for Termux + GPT.
- GitHub Orbit-removal commit: 64dc43b Ditch Orbit. The Termux-side reference 71cdd8b remains recorded above; its equivalence to the GitHub commit is not verified.
- Last sync: 2026-11-11T02:30Z; test-harness fixes are committed at 67f1458. Scoped fake approvals and valid mocked open-PR inventory replace unintended live gh calls; no GH_TOKEN was added to CI.
- Next task: Obtain a fresh exact-head full repository suite, dependency audit and fail-closed gate on PR #1661; keep XRP forecasts NOT_ISSUED.

## Conversation Log
- 2026-11-10: User + ChatGPT established LunaRoute as sole brain, Orbit ditched.
